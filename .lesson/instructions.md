# Unit D3 Lesson 7: File Input/Output
In this lesson you will learn how to read from and write to a text file from your Java program.
## Instructions: 
* In your program, create a text file that contains one line of text: "This is my text file"
* When your program runs, display the existing text in the console. 
* Prompt the user to enter a new line of text, then save that line of text to the text in the file.
* When you relaunch the program, any previous text you added to the file should be there.
